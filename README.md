## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to my **Power BI Sales Dashboard** – your one-stop shop for exploring who’s buying what, when, and how much profit it’s bringing in. Whether you're a data nerd or just love colorful graphs, this one’s for you. 📈✨

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** – because Excel needed a glow-up  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for good ol' data cleaning and prep

---

## 🔍 Dashboard Highlights

✅ **Total Sales by Category**  
Bar charts that show how well Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture are doing — including who's buying them (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office). Spoiler alert: Everyone loves chairs.

📈 **Profit and Sales by Year**  
A fancy dual-axis line chart that reveals how sales and profit climbed from 2011 to 2014. Growth = good, right?

🌍 **Profit by Country**  
Map view because data looks cooler when it’s on a globe. Hover to explore!

🍩 **Top Profitable Products**  
Donut chart – yes, it looks delicious – showing the top 5 cash cows in the product lineup.

📌 **KPI Cards**  
- 💰 Total Profit: **283K**  
- 🛒 Total Sales: **2M**  
Because what's a dashboard without big numbers in bold fonts?
